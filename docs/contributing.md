- **Admin view**: To add repositories head to `/admin/`. Add repositories to the system, which you want to use. The system will fetch the issues of these repositories. you have to fill the username and repo name. Some user-repos that support the system are given below in the `Supported Repositories` section below, use these repos to start off.
- Now you also have to setup worker server (alongside main server) for fetching github issues periodically (15 mins). For this follow these steps:
    - Open another terminal and run `celery -A issue_parser beat -l info`.
    - Open one more terminal and run `celery -A issue_parser worker -l info`
- Now fire up a browser and go to `/issues/` for seeing the json data of issues.
